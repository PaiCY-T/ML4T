## Objective
Validate momentum factors show predictive power in TSE using ProfessionalFactorEvaluator to establish quantitative foundation for weekly/monthly trading strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement 3-5 momentum factors (price momentum, earnings momentum, analyst revision)
- [ ] ProfessionalFactorEvaluator for robust IC calculation and significance testing
- [ ] Historical IC analysis across different market regimes (bull/bear/sideways)
- [ ] Factor correlation analysis and redundancy detection
- [ ] Statistical significance testing with multiple hypothesis correction
- [ ] Factor decay analysis and optimal holding periods
- [ ] Performance attribution and factor exposure analysis
- [ ] IC threshold validation: target IC > 0.02 for factor inclusion

## Technical Requirements
- Statistical significance testing (t-tests, Newey-West corrections)
- Rolling IC analysis with confidence intervals
- Factor orthogonalization techniques
- Performance attribution framework
- Robust outlier handling and winsorization
- Memory-efficient factor calculation for large universes

## Deliverables
- FactorEngine module with momentum factor implementations
- ProfessionalFactorEvaluator for comprehensive factor analysis
- IC validation framework with statistical testing
- Factor correlation and exposure analysis tools
- Documentation of factor construction methodology
- Comprehensive test suite for factor calculations

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria met
- IC analysis shows statistically significant predictive power
- Factor construction methodology documented
- Performance benchmarks achieved
- Code reviewed and tested with >80% coverage

## Notes
Critical validation layer ensuring factor alpha before strategy implementation. Focus on statistical rigor and Taiwan market-specific factor behavior analysis.
