# Task 006: Performance Analytics Framework

## Overview

Build a comprehensive performance analytics framework that provides real-time tracking, attribution analysis, and risk monitoring for the multi-strategy trading system. The framework will leverage FinLab's reporting capabilities while adding custom analytics for factor attribution and regime-aware performance measurement.

## Objectives

- Implement daily performance tracking and attribution system
- Build comprehensive risk metrics and monitoring dashboard
- Create factor attribution and exposure analysis framework
- Develop regime-aware performance analytics
- Integrate with FinLab reporting for standardized metrics

## Scope

### In Scope
- Daily portfolio performance calculation and tracking
- Factor attribution and exposure analysis
- Risk metrics monitoring (Sharpe, CAGR, MDD, VaR)
- Regime analysis and conditional performance metrics
- Automated reporting and alerting system
- Integration with FinLab backtest.report() framework

### Out of Scope
- Real-time trading execution monitoring (separate system)
- Alternative data integration (future enhancement)
- Complex derivative pricing models
- Third-party reporting platform integration

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Calculation
- Daily returns calculation with accurate cost attribution
- Portfolio-level and strategy-level performance tracking
- Benchmark-relative performance measurement
- Time-weighted and money-weighted return calculations

### Attribution Framework
- Factor exposure attribution (momentum, value, quality, size)
- Sector allocation attribution effects
- Security selection vs allocation attribution
- Timing attribution for rebalancing decisions

### Risk Analytics
- Standard risk metrics: VaR, CVaR, maximum drawdown
- Rolling risk measures: volatility, beta, tracking error
- Regime-conditional risk analysis
- Stress testing and scenario analysis

### Reporting Integration
- FinLab backtest.report() for standardized metrics
- Custom performance dashboards and visualizations
- Automated daily/weekly/monthly reports
- Alert system for performance and risk thresholds

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Analytics (Week 1-2)
- Implement daily performance calculation engine
- Build portfolio and strategy-level tracking
- Create basic risk metrics calculation
- Set up data pipeline for performance data

### Phase 2: Attribution Framework (Week 3-4)
- Build factor attribution analysis system
- Implement sector and security attribution
- Create timing attribution for rebalancing
- Develop attribution reporting and visualization

### Phase 3: Risk Analytics (Week 5-6)
- Implement comprehensive risk metrics suite
- Build regime-aware risk analysis
- Create stress testing framework
- Develop risk monitoring and alerting

### Phase 4: Reporting & Integration (Week 7-8)
- Integrate with FinLab reporting framework
- Build automated reporting system
- Create performance dashboards
- Implement alerting and notification system

## Deliverables

### Core Analytics Engine
- `src/analytics/performance.py` - Daily performance calculation
- `src/analytics/attribution.py` - Factor and allocation attribution
- `src/analytics/risk.py` - Risk metrics and monitoring
- `src/analytics/regime.py` - Regime-aware analytics

### Reporting Framework
- `src/reporting/daily_report.py` - Daily performance reporting
- `src/reporting/attribution_report.py` - Attribution analysis reports
- `src/reporting/risk_report.py` - Risk monitoring reports
- `src/reporting/dashboard.py` - Performance dashboard

### Integration
- `src/integration/finlab_reporting.py` - FinLab integration layer
- `src/alerts/performance_alerts.py` - Automated alerting system
- `src/utils/metrics.py` - Custom metrics calculations

### Configuration
- `config/analytics/performance_config.yml` - Performance calculation settings
- `config/analytics/attribution_config.yml` - Attribution framework settings
- `config/alerts/thresholds.yml` - Alert thresholds and rules

## Success Criteria

### Performance Tracking
- Daily performance calculation within 1 hour of market close
- Accurate attribution to factors and allocation decisions
- Real-time risk monitoring with <5 minute latency
- Comprehensive performance history with 10+ years backfill

### Analytical Quality
- Factor attribution accuracy within 10bps daily
- Risk metrics calculation matching industry standards
- Regime analysis covering multiple market cycles
- Performance persistence analysis and significance testing

### Operational Requirements
- Automated daily reporting and distribution
- Configurable alert thresholds and notification channels
- Integration with existing strategy and backtest frameworks
- Scalable architecture for multiple strategies and portfolios

## Key Metrics Framework

### Return Metrics
- **Daily/Weekly/Monthly Returns**: Gross and net of costs
- **Cumulative Returns**: Total return since inception
- **Annualized Returns**: CAGR with different time periods
- **Excess Returns**: Outperformance vs benchmark (TWSE)

### Risk Metrics
- **Volatility**: Rolling 20/60/252 day volatility
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns (target > 2.0)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Peak-to-trough losses (target < 15%)
- **Value at Risk**: 95%/99% daily/monthly VaR

### Attribution Metrics
- **Factor Exposure**: Momentum, value, quality, size exposures
- **Sector Attribution**: Over/underweight sector allocation effects
- **Security Selection**: Stock picking vs benchmark attribution
- **Timing Attribution**: Rebalancing timing effects

### Regime Analytics
- **Regime Classification**: Bull/bear/sideways market identification
- **Conditional Performance**: Performance by market regime
- **Regime Transition**: Performance during regime changes
- **Persistence Analysis**: Performance consistency across regimes

## Dependencies

- Task 001: Core data infrastructure for daily portfolio data
- Task 002: Strategy framework for performance calculation
- Task 003: ML infrastructure for factor attribution

## Risks & Mitigation

### Data Quality Risks
- **Pricing accuracy**: Multiple data source validation
- **Corporate actions**: Automated adjustment verification
- **Benchmark data**: Reliable benchmark calculation and tracking

### Calculation Risks
- **Attribution accuracy**: Cross-validation with alternative methods
- **Performance calculation**: Independent verification systems
- **Risk model validity**: Regular model validation and updating

### Operational Risks
- **System availability**: Redundant calculation and reporting systems
- **Alert fatigue**: Carefully calibrated threshold management
- **Data storage**: Efficient historical data management

## Taiwan Market Considerations

### Local Benchmarks
- **TWSE Index**: Primary equity benchmark
- **Sector Indices**: Technology, financials, industrials
- **Style Indices**: Growth, value, dividend yield

### Market Characteristics
- **Trading Hours**: 09:00-13:30 local time reporting
- **Settlement**: T+2 settlement impact on performance
- **Dividends**: Ex-dividend date handling for total returns
- **Currency**: TWD reporting with USD conversion option
