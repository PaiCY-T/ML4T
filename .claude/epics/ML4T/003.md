## Objective
Implement precise Taiwan transaction cost modeling (0.37% roundtrip) with detailed breakdown of fees, taxes, and slippage to ensure accurate backtesting and realistic performance expectations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Taiwan brokerage fee modeling: 0.1425% (max 0.4% per trade)
- [ ] Securities transaction tax: 0.3% on sell orders only
- [ ] Market impact and slippage modeling based on trade size and liquidity
- [ ] Bid-ask spread estimation using historical data
- [ ] Integration with FinLab backtesting framework
- [ ] Cost model validation against real trading costs
- [ ] Performance impact analysis on strategy returns
- [ ] Configurable cost parameters for sensitivity analysis

## Technical Requirements
- Accurate Taiwan market cost structure implementation
- Liquidity-based slippage modeling
- Integration with existing backtesting infrastructure
- Cost attribution and breakdown reporting
- Sensitivity analysis tools for cost parameters
- Performance comparison with and without costs

## Deliverables
- Taiwan cost modeling module with detailed breakdown
- Integration with FinLab backtesting framework
- Cost impact analysis and reporting tools
- Validation against actual trading costs
- Documentation of Taiwan market cost structure
- Unit tests for all cost calculations

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria met
- Cost model validated against real trading data
- Integration with backtesting framework complete
- Performance impact analysis documented
- Code reviewed and tested with >90% coverage

## Notes
Essential for realistic performance evaluation. Taiwan market has specific cost structure (0.3% tax on sells only) that significantly impacts strategy performance and must be modeled accurately.
