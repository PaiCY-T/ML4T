# Epic: ML4T

## Overview

ML4T is a personal quantitative trading system designed for Taiwan stock markets (TSE/OTC) with weekly and monthly trading cycles. The system aims to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns through multi-strategy quantitative approaches, targeting >20% annual returns with <15% maximum drawdown and >2 Sharpe ratio. Built on Python 3.11 with FinLab data integration and Fubon API execution, the system supports flexible strategy development and risk management for personal capital deployment.

## Problem Context

### What problem are we solving?
- **Manual Trading Limitations**: Traditional discretionary trading lacks systematic approach, consistency, and scalability
- **Emotional Decision Making**: Human bias and emotional responses lead to suboptimal trading decisions
- **Limited Strategy Coverage**: Single-strategy approaches miss diversification benefits across market regimes
- **Inefficient Risk Management**: Manual portfolio management cannot effectively balance risk across positions and strategies

### Why is this important now?
- Taiwan stock market offers significant alpha opportunities for systematic approaches
- Advanced ML techniques and alternative data provide competitive advantages
- FinLab platform provides comprehensive Taiwan market data infrastructure
- Personal capital scale (30M NTD) requires professional-grade systematic approach

## Core Requirements
- **Multi-Strategy Framework**: Support for momentum, value, and ML-based strategies
- **Flexible Holding Periods**: Adaptive position duration based on signal strength and market conditions
- **Strategy Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for adding new alpha strategies
- **Risk Parity Allocation**: Dynamic capital allocation across strategies based on risk contribution

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Annual Return**: Target >20% risk-adjusted returns
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Achieve >2.0 Sharpe ratio consistently
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Maintain <15% maximum drawdown
- **Win Rate**: Strategy-dependent but aim for >55% overall

### Secondary Metrics
- **Volatility**: Keep portfolio volatility 12-18% annually
- **Turnover**: Optimize for <200% annual turnover
- **Transaction Costs**: Keep total costs <0.5% annually
- **System Uptime**: Maintain >99% operational availability

### Validation Criteria
- **Backtesting**: 10+ years out-of-sample validation
- **Walk-Forward**: 3-year rolling window validation
- **Deflated Sharpe**: Statistical significance testing
- **Regime Testing**: Performance across bull/bear/sideways markets

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- DataHub implementation with FinLab integration
- Basic factor engineering pipeline
- Local data storage setup
- Development environment configuration

### Phase 2: Strategy Development (Weeks 5-8)
- MOM_W momentum strategy implementation
- VAL_M value strategy implementation
- ML_RANK initial model development
- Backtesting framework completion

### Phase 3: Risk & Execution (Weeks 9-12)

- Fubon API integration and testing
- Portfolio allocation optimization
- End-to-end system testing

### Phase 4: Deployment & Optimization (Weeks 13-16)
- Live trading with small capital
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Strategy refinement based on live results
- Gradual capital scaling
