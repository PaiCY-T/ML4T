## Objective
Establish robust Taiwan market data pipeline leveraging IncrementalUpdater + FinLab API for consistent, validated data access supporting weekly/monthly trading strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FinLab API integration with proper authentication and rate limiting
- [ ] IncrementalUpdater implementation for efficient data synchronization
- [ ] 10+ years TSE/OTC historical data validation and completeness check
- [ ] Local Parquet storage with optimized schema for factor calculations
- [ ] Data quality checks and anomaly detection
- [ ] Automated daily data refresh pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarks: <5min daily updates, <30s factor data loading

## Technical Requirements
- FinLab API v1.7+ integration
- Parquet format with PyArrow backend
- Data validation framework with statistical checks
- Memory-efficient data structures for large datasets
- Error handling and retry mechanisms for API failures

## Deliverables
- DataHub module with IncrementalUpdater
- Data validation and quality assurance pipeline
- Local storage optimization for Taiwan market data
- Documentation for data schema and update procedures
- Unit tests with >80% coverage

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code reviewed and tested
- Documentation complete
- Performance benchmarks achieved
- Integration tests passing

## Notes
Foundation layer for all subsequent ML4T tasks. Focus on data reliability and efficient access patterns to support factor engineering and backtesting workflows.
