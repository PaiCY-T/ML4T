# Task 005: Backtesting Engine Integration

## Overview

Build a comprehensive backtesting engine that integrates with FinLab's backtest.sim() framework to provide robust historical validation of trading strategies. The engine will support walk-forward validation, regime analysis, and Taiwan-specific transaction costs for accurate performance assessment.

## Objectives

- Integrate FinLab backtest.sim() for comprehensive historical testing
- Implement walk-forward validation for out-of-sample performance
- Build regime analysis framework for different market conditions
- Configure Taiwan-specific transaction costs and market microstructure
- Create automated backtesting pipeline for strategy validation

## Scope

### In Scope
- FinLab backtest.sim() integration and configuration
- Walk-forward validation framework (3-year train, 1-year test)
- Taiwan market transaction cost modeling (fees, taxes, slippage)
- Regime analysis and performance attribution
- Automated backtesting pipeline with reporting
- Performance metrics calculation and benchmarking

### Out of Scope
- Real-time trading execution (covered in other tasks)
- Portfolio optimization algorithms (separate task)
- Alternative backtesting engines beyond FinLab
- High-frequency trading considerations

## Technical Requirements

### Backtesting Framework
- Engine: FinLab backtest.sim() with custom extensions
- Data period: 2012-2025 (10+ years including multiple cycles)
- Frequency: Weekly and monthly rebalancing support
- Universe: TSE/OTC with survivorship bias correction

### Transaction Cost Model
- Brokerage fees: 0.1425% (negotiable, configurable)
- Securities transaction tax: 0.3%
- Market impact: 5bps slippage model
- Bid-ask spread: Dynamic based on liquidity measures

### Walk-Forward Validation
- Training window: 3 years rolling
- Testing window: 1 year out-of-sample
- Step size: 1 year (annual retraining)
- Minimum lookback: 2012-2015 for first test period

### Performance Metrics
- Return metrics: CAGR, total return, excess return vs benchmark
- Risk metrics: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown
- Risk-adjusted: Information ratio, Calmar ratio, Deflated Sharpe
- Attribution: Factor exposure, sector allocation, timing effects

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Week 1-2)
- Set up FinLab backtest.sim() framework
- Configure Taiwan market parameters and costs
- Implement basic strategy backtesting pipeline
- Create performance metrics calculation engine

### Phase 2: Walk-Forward Framework (Week 3-4)
- Build walk-forward validation infrastructure
- Implement rolling window training and testing
- Create out-of-sample performance tracking
- Develop model retraining automation

### Phase 3: Regime Analysis (Week 5-6)
- Implement market regime identification
- Build regime-specific performance analysis
- Create conditional performance metrics
- Develop regime transition handling

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics (Week 7-8)
- Build comprehensive attribution analysis
- Implement Deflated Sharpe ratio calculation
- Create benchmark comparison framework
- Develop performance persistence analysis

### Phase 5: Automation & Reporting (Week 9-10)
- Create automated backtesting pipeline
- Build comprehensive reporting system
- Implement result validation and quality checks
- Create visualization and dashboard integration

## Deliverables

### Core Engine
- `src/backtest/engine.py` - Main backtesting engine
- `src/backtest/costs.py` - Transaction cost modeling
- `src/backtest/metrics.py` - Performance metrics calculation
- `src/backtest/walk_forward.py` - Walk-forward validation framework

### Analysis Framework
- `src/analysis/regime.py` - Market regime analysis
- `src/analysis/attribution.py` - Performance attribution
- `src/analysis/benchmark.py` - Benchmark comparison
- `src/reporting/backtest_report.py` - Automated reporting

### Configuration
- `config/backtest/engine_config.yml` - Backtesting parameters
- `config/backtest/costs_taiwan.yml` - Taiwan market costs
- `config/analysis/regimes.yml` - Regime definitions

### Documentation
- Backtesting methodology and assumptions
- Transaction cost model validation
- Walk-forward validation framework
- Performance metrics definitions

## Success Criteria

### Technical Performance
- Complete 10+ year backtest in < 5 minutes
- Support for 2000+ stock universe
- Accurate transaction cost modeling within 5bps
- Robust handling of corporate actions and delistings

### Analytical Quality
- Walk-forward validation with 8+ out-of-sample periods
- Regime analysis covering bull/bear/sideways markets
- Comprehensive attribution to factors and timing
- Statistical significance testing for performance metrics

### Operational Requirements
- Automated daily backtesting capability
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Configuration-driven parameter management
- Integration with existing strategy framework

## Dependencies

- Task 001: Core data infrastructure and FinLab integration
- Task 002: Base strategy framework and interfaces
- Task 003: ML infrastructure for model validation

## Risks & Mitigation

### Data Quality Risks
- **Survivorship bias**: Use FinLab complete universe with delisted stocks
- **Look-ahead bias**: Strict point-in-time data validation
- **Corporate actions**: Automated adjustment handling with validation

### Model Validation Risks
- **Overfitting**: Multiple out-of-sample periods and regime testing
- **Data snooping**: Consistent validation framework across strategies
- **Parameter stability**: Sensitivity analysis and robustness testing

### Technical Risks
- **Performance issues**: Optimized data structures and parallel processing
- **Memory constraints**: Efficient data loading and chunking strategies
- **Result reproducibility**: Deterministic random seeds and data handling

## Taiwan Market Considerations

### Market Structure
- Trading hours: 09:00-13:30 Taiwan time
- Settlement: T+2 standard settlement cycle
- Market makers: Limited compared to US markets
- Liquidity: Concentrated in large-cap stocks

### Regulatory Environment
- Position limits: 10% individual stock holding regulations
- Margin requirements: Conservative leverage constraints
- Short selling: Limited availability and higher costs
- Tax implications: Securities transaction tax impact

## Notes

- Emphasis on out-of-sample validation for robust results
- Taiwan-specific cost structure critical for accurate performance
- Regime analysis essential for strategy robustness assessment
- Integration with existing FinLab infrastructure for efficiency
