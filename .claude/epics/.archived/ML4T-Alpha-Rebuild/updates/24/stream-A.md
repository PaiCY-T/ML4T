## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Cost Model Architecture
```
Market Data → Cost Calculator → Taiwan Regulatory → Market Impact
     ↓              ↓              ↓                ↓
Volume/Price → Linear/NonLinear → Tax/Commission → Temp/Permanent
     ↓              ↓              ↓                ↓
Execution → Timing/Slippage → Settlement T+2 → Cost Attribution
```
