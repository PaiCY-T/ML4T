# Issue #003: Factor Engineering Pipeline

## Overview
Implement 42 handcrafted factors with performance tracking and IC calculation.

## Scope
**Timeline**: Week 5 (40 hours)
**Dependencies**: Issues #001, #002 (Data Pipeline + Backtesting)
**Parallel Streams**: 3

## Stream A: Technical Indicators (16h)
**Files**: `src/factors/technical/`, `src/factors/momentum/`
**Responsibilities**:
- Momentum factors (12 indicators)
- Mean reversion factors (8 indicators)
- Volatility factors (6 indicators)
- Technical pattern recognition

## Stream B: Fundamental Factors (16h)
**Files**: `src/factors/fundamental/`, `src/factors/quality/`
**Responsibilities**:
- Value factors (8 indicators)
- Quality factors (6 indicators)
- Growth factors (4 indicators)
- Taiwan market specific adjustments

## Stream C: Factor Infrastructure (8h)
**Files**: `src/factors/core/`, `src/factors/tracking/`
**Responsibilities**:
- Factor calculation engine
- IC (Information Coefficient) tracking
- Factor performance monitoring
- Correlation analysis tools

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 42 factors implemented and tested
- [ ] IC calculation working for all factors
- [ ] Factor performance tracking active
- [ ] Correlation analysis functional
- [ ] Taiwan market adaptations complete
- [ ] Memory-efficient factor calculation
- [ ] Comprehensive factor documentation

## Technical Requirements
- NumPy/Pandas for efficient calculation
- Integration with data pipeline from #001
- Support for rolling window calculations
- Factor metadata and documentation
- Performance optimization for large datasets

## Deliverables
1. 42 handcrafted factor implementations
2. IC tracking and monitoring system
3. Factor performance analytics
4. Correlation analysis tools
5. Taiwan market adaptations
6. Factor documentation and metadata
