## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources Integration
- **Price Data**: TEJ, Bloomberg Taiwan feeds
- **Fundamental Data**: TEJ financial statements, analyst estimates
- **Market Data**: TSE/TPEx official data, foreign flow data
- **Alternative Data**: News sentiment, social media indicators

### Factor Storage Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE factor_values (
    date DATE,
    symbol VARCHAR(10),
    factor_name VARCHAR(50),
    value DECIMAL(15,6),
    percentile_rank DECIMAL(5,4),
    z_score DECIMAL(8,4),
    PRIMARY KEY (date, symbol, factor_name)
);
```

### Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: Individual factor calculations
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline validation
- **Regression Tests**: Historical factor stability
- **Performance Tests**: Computation speed benchmarks

## Dependencies

**Requires Completion Of**:
