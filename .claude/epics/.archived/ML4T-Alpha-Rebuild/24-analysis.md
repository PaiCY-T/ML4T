# Issue #24 Analysis: Transaction Cost Modeling

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Cost Model Framework
**Focus**: Transaction cost models, Taiwan market microstructure, cost estimation
**Files**: 
- `src/trading/costs/cost_models.py` - Core transaction cost models
- `src/trading/costs/taiwan_microstructure.py` - Taiwan market cost models
- `src/trading/costs/execution_models.py` - Execution cost simulation

**Work**:
- Implement linear and non-linear transaction cost models
- Build Taiwan market microstructure models (bid-ask, impact)
- Create execution cost simulation with market timing
- Add slippage and market impact modeling
- Handle Taiwan market specifics (T+2 settlement, tick sizes)

### Stream B: Market Impact & Liquidity
**Focus**: Market impact modeling, liquidity analysis, capacity constraints
**Files**:
- `src/trading/costs/market_impact.py` - Market impact modeling
- `src/trading/costs/liquidity.py` - Liquidity analysis and constraints
- `src/trading/costs/capacity.py` - Strategy capacity modeling
- `src/trading/costs/timing.py` - Execution timing optimization

**Work**:
- Build temporary and permanent market impact models
- Implement liquidity analysis with ADV constraints
- Create strategy capacity limits based on market impact
- Add execution timing optimization (TWAP, VWAP)
- Model Taiwan market liquidity characteristics

### Stream C: Integration & Optimization
**Focus**: Backtesting integration, cost optimization, performance validation
**Files**:
- `src/trading/costs/backtest_integration.py` - Backtesting cost integration
- `src/trading/optimization/cost_optimizer.py` - Cost-aware optimization
- `tests/trading/test_cost_models.py` - Comprehensive cost tests
- `benchmarks/cost_performance.py` - Cost model benchmarks

**Work**:
- Integrate cost models with walk-forward validation (Issue #23)
- Build cost-aware portfolio optimization
- Create comprehensive testing for all cost scenarios
- Validate cost models against historical Taiwan market data
- Optimize cost calculations for real-time trading

## Coordination Points
1. **Stream A** creates cost models that **Stream B** enhances with liquidity
2. **Stream C** integrates **Stream A & B** with validation and optimization systems
3. **Stream B** provides capacity constraints that **Stream C** uses in optimization
4. All streams coordinate on Taiwan market microstructure accuracy

## Dependencies
- **Issue #21**: Point-in-time data management system (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Issue #22**: Data quality validation framework (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Issue #23**: Walk-forward validation engine (running in parallel)
- Integration with temporal data and validation systems

## Success Criteria
- Accurate transaction cost modeling for Taiwan market
- Market impact and liquidity constraint modeling
- Integration with backtesting and optimization systems
- Real-time cost calculation capability (<10ms)
- Strategy capacity analysis and limits
- Taiwan market microstructure compliance

## Key Taiwan Market Requirements
- T+2 settlement cost modeling
- Taiwan tick size and lot size handling
- TSE/TPEx market microstructure differences
- Securities lending costs and availability
- Taiwan trading hours and session breaks
- Holiday and suspension cost implications
- Regulatory fee structure (transaction tax, exchange fees)
