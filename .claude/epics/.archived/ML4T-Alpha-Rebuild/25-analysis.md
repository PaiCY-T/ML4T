# Task 25 Analysis: 42 Handcrafted Factors Implementation

## Executive Summary

**Scope**: Implement 42 handcrafted factors for Taiwan market ML pipeline
**Dependencies**: Tasks #23 (Walk-Forward Validation) ✅ and #24 (Transaction Cost Modeling) ✅ 
**Complexity**: Medium-High (comprehensive factor engineering)
**Parallelization**: 3 streams (Technical, Fundamental, Market Microstructure)

## Implementation Strategy

### Stream Architecture

**Stream A: Technical Indicators (18 factors)**
- Focus: Momentum, mean reversion, volatility factors
- Dependencies: Point-in-time price/volume data
- Timeline: 2-3 days
- Agent: Quantitative specialist

**Stream B: Fundamental Factors (12 factors)** 
- Focus: Value, quality, growth factors
- Dependencies: Financial statement data with 60-day lag compliance
- Timeline: 2-3 days
- Agent: Fundamental analyst specialist

**Stream C: Market Microstructure (12 factors)**
- Focus: Liquidity, volume patterns, Taiwan-specific factors
- Dependencies: Market microstructure data, foreign flow data
- Timeline: 2-3 days
- Agent: Market structure specialist

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Stream A)
```python
# Core factor calculation engine
class FactorEngine:
    def __init__(self, data_pipeline):
        self.data_pipeline = data_pipeline  # From Task #23
        self.cost_model = cost_model        # From Task #24
        
    def calculate_technical_factors(self, universe, dates):
        # Implement 18 technical factors
        # Handle Taiwan market specifics
        pass
```

### Phase 2: Fundamental Integration (Stream B)
```python 
# Fundamental factor calculations
class FundamentalFactors:
    def calculate_value_factors(self, financials, prices):
        # P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, P/S ratios
        # Apply 60-day reporting lag compliance
        pass
        
    def calculate_quality_factors(self, financials):
        # ROE, ROA, debt ratios, earnings quality
        # Handle Taiwan GAAP specifics
        pass
```

### Phase 3: Market Structure (Stream C)
```python
# Taiwan market microstructure factors  
class MarketMicrostructure:
    def calculate_liquidity_factors(self, tick_data):
        # Amihud ratio, bid-ask spreads, volume patterns
        # Apply Taiwan market hours (09:00-13:30)
        pass
        
    def taiwan_specific_factors(self, foreign_flows, margin_data):
        # Foreign institutional flows, margin ratios
        # Cross-strait sentiment indicators
        pass
```

## Integration Requirements

### Data Pipeline Integration
- **Point-in-Time Access**: Leverage Task #23 temporal data system
- **Data Quality**: Use Task #22 validation framework 
- **Cost Awareness**: Factor in transaction costs from Task #24

### Taiwan Market Compliance
- **Reporting Lags**: 60-day financial data lag enforcement
- **Settlement**: T+2 cycle considerations in factor calculations
- **Price Limits**: Daily 10% limit adjustments
- **Trading Hours**: Market closure at 13:30 TST

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Data Availability**: Some factors may have missing data periods
- **Computation Performance**: 42 factors across full universe may be intensive
- **Memory Usage**: Target <8GB during computation

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Chunked Processing**: Calculate factors in batches
- **Caching**: Store intermediate calculations
- **Fallback Methods**: Alternative calculations for missing data
- **Vectorization**: Use NumPy/Pandas optimized operations

## Success Criteria

### Performance Targets
- **Speed**: <10 minutes for full universe factor refresh
- **Coverage**: >95% of investable stocks
- **Information Content**: Average |IC| >0.03
- **Memory**: <8GB peak usage

### Quality Standards
- **Data Completeness**: <5% missing after imputation
- **Factor Stability**: <20% month-over-month rank correlation change
- **Diversification**: Max pairwise correlation <0.7
- **Economic Logic**: All factors pass intuition review

## Parallel Execution Plan

### Stream Coordination
1. **Streams A, B, C launch in parallel**
2. **Common infrastructure shared**: Factor storage, validation framework
3. **Integration point**: Final factor universe assembly
4. **Testing**: Cross-stream correlation analysis

### Dependencies Resolution
- **Internal**: All streams need basic factor calculation framework
- **External**: Point-in-time data (Task #23), validation framework (Task #22)
- **Coordination**: Regular sync points for schema alignment

## Expected Deliverables
