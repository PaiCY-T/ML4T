## Technical Scope

### LightGBM Architecture

#### Model Configuration
```python
class LightGBMAlphaModel:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.base_params = {
            'objective': 'regression',
            'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
            'metric': 'rmse',
            'num_leaves': 31,
            'learning_rate': 0.05,
            'feature_fraction': 0.8,
            'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
            'bagging_freq': 5,
            'verbose': -1,
            'random_state': 42
        }
        
    def train_with_cv(self, X, y, groups):
        # Time-series aware cross-validation
        # Hyperparameter optimization
        # Feature selection
        pass
```

#### Target Engineering
- **Forward Returns**: 1D, 5D, 10D, 20D forward returns
- **Risk-Adjusted Targets**: Sharpe-based targets, downside-adjusted returns
- **Ranking Targets**: Cross-sectional return rankings
- **Volatility Normalization**: Risk-scaled return predictions

### Time-Series Cross-Validation Framework

#### Purged GroupKFold Implementation
```python
class PurgedGroupTimeSeriesSplit:
    def __init__(self, n_splits=5, embargo_td=2):
        self.n_splits = n_splits
        self.embargo_td = embargo_td  # Trading days embargo
        
    def split(self, X, y, groups):
        # Implement gap-based CV to prevent data leakage
        # Account for Taiwan market T+2 settlement
        # Maintain temporal ordering
        pass
```

#### Validation Strategy
- **Walk-Forward Analysis**: Expanding window with 6-month retraining
- **Purged CV**: 2-day embargo to prevent lookahead bias
- **Group-Based**: Split by time periods, not individual observations
- **Market Regime Awareness**: Separate validation for bull/bear markets

### Hyperparameter Optimization

#### Search Space Definition
```python
HYPERPARAMETER_SPACE = {
    'num_leaves': (10, 300),
    'max_depth': (3, 12),
    'learning_rate': (0.01, 0.3),
    'feature_fraction': (0.4, 1.0),
    'bagging_fraction': (0.4, 1.0),
    'lambda_l1': (0, 100),
    'lambda_l2': (0, 100),
    'min_child_samples': (5, 100),
    'subsample_for_bin': (20000, 300000)
}
```

#### Optimization Strategy
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Optuna for efficient search
- **Multi-Objective**: Balance accuracy vs overfitting vs speed
- **Early Stopping**: Prevent overfitting with validation monitoring
- **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple models with different hyperparameters

### Feature Engineering Integration

#### Factor Processing Pipeline
```python
class FeatureProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scalers = {}
        self.feature_selector = None
        
    def prepare_features(self, factor_data):
        # Standardization and normalization
        # Outlier handling (winsorization)
        # Missing value imputation
        # Feature selection based on importance
        pass
```

#### Taiwan Market Features
- **Market Regime Indicators**: Bull/bear market, volatility regime
- **Sector Rotation Signals**: Relative sector performance
- **Foreign Flow Features**: Institutional buying pressure
- **Technical Regime**: Trending vs mean-reverting markets

### Model Performance Tracking

#### Real-Time Monitoring
```python
class ModelMonitor:
    def __init__(self, model, thresholds):
        self.model = model
        self.performance_metrics = {}
        self.drift_detectors = {}
        
    def track_performance(self, predictions, actuals, features):
        # Calculate rolling IC and Sharpe
        # Monitor feature importance drift
        # Detect regime changes
        # Generate retraining alerts
        pass

        # Residual analysis
        # Prediction distribution analysis
