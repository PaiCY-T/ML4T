# Issue #22 Analysis: Data Quality Validation Framework

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Core Validation Engine
**Focus**: Data quality validation algorithms, rule engine, Taiwan market validators
**Files**: 
- `src/data/quality/validation_engine.py` - Core validation framework
- `src/data/quality/taiwan_validators.py` - Taiwan market-specific validators
- `src/data/quality/rules_engine.py` - Configurable validation rules

**Work**:
- Design extensible validation framework with plugin architecture
- Implement Taiwan market data validators (price limits, volume checks)
- Create rule engine for configurable validation logic
- Add data completeness, accuracy, and consistency validators
- Handle 60-day financial data lag validation

### Stream B: Monitoring & Alerting System
**Focus**: Real-time monitoring, alerting, dashboard, quality metrics
**Files**:
- `src/data/quality/monitor.py` - Real-time quality monitoring
- `src/data/quality/alerting.py` - Alert system with multiple channels
- `src/data/quality/dashboard.py` - Quality metrics dashboard
- `src/data/quality/metrics.py` - Quality scoring and KPIs

**Work**:
- Build real-time data quality monitoring system
- Implement multi-channel alerting (email, Slack, webhook)
- Create quality metrics dashboard with visualizations
- Add quality scoring algorithms and trend analysis
- Set up automated quality reports and SLA tracking

### Stream C: Integration & Testing
**Focus**: Point-in-time integration, performance optimization, comprehensive testing
**Files**:
- `src/data/quality/pit_integration.py` - Integration with PIT system
- `tests/data/quality/test_validation_framework.py` - Comprehensive tests
- `tests/data/quality/test_taiwan_validators.py` - Taiwan market tests
- `benchmarks/quality_performance.py` - Performance benchmarks

**Work**:
- Integrate with Issue #21's point-in-time data system
- Optimize validation performance for real-time processing
- Build comprehensive test suite for all validators
- Create performance benchmarks and optimization
- Validate against historical Taiwan market data anomalies

## Coordination Points
1. **Stream A** creates validation interfaces that **Stream B** monitors
2. **Stream C** integrates **Stream A** validators with point-in-time system from Issue #21
3. **Stream B** provides alerting for quality issues detected by **Stream A**
4. All streams collaborate on Taiwan market-specific validation requirements

## Dependencies
- **Issue #21**: Point-in-time data management system (âœ… COMPLETED)
- Integration with temporal data store and Taiwan market models
- FinLab data connection established in Issue #21

## Success Criteria
- Real-time data quality validation with <10ms latency
- Taiwan market compliance (price limits, trading hours, settlement rules)
- 60-day fundamental data lag properly validated
- Comprehensive alerting with configurable thresholds
- >95% data quality score maintenance
- Integration with existing point-in-time system from Issue #21

## Taiwan Market Specific Requirements
- Price limit validation (10% daily limits)
- Volume spike detection and validation
- Trading hour compliance (09:00-13:30 TST)
- T+2 settlement validation
- Corporate action data quality checks
- Fundamental data staleness detection (60-day lag)
