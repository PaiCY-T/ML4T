# Issue #002: Backtesting Framework

## Overview
Implement professional backtesting framework with walk-forward validation and Taiwan market transaction costs.

## Scope
**Timeline**: Week 3-4 (32 hours)
**Dependencies**: Issue #001 (Data Pipeline)
**Parallel Streams**: 2

## Stream A: Walk-Forward Validation Engine (20h)
**Files**: `src/backtest/validation/`, `src/backtest/engine/`
**Responsibilities**:
- 156-week training / 26-week testing splits
- Purged K-fold cross-validation
- Time-series specific validation
- Out-of-sample performance tracking

## Stream B: Transaction Cost & Attribution (12h)
**Files**: `src/backtest/costs/`, `src/backtest/attribution/`
**Responsibilities**:
- Taiwan market transaction cost modeling
- Performance attribution system
- Risk-adjusted metrics calculation
- Benchmark comparison framework

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Walk-forward validation with proper time splits
- [ ] Purged K-fold preventing data leakage
- [ ] Taiwan transaction costs modeled accurately
- [ ] Performance attribution working
- [ ] Risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Information Ratio)
- [ ] Benchmark comparison functionality
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>85%)

## Technical Requirements
- Integration with Issue #001 data pipeline
- Support for multiple strategies
- Efficient memory usage for large backtests
- Parallel processing capability
- Result caching and serialization

## Deliverables
1. Walk-forward validation engine
2. Purged K-fold cross-validation
3. Transaction cost modeling
4. Performance attribution system
5. Risk-adjusted metrics calculation
6. Integration tests and benchmarks
