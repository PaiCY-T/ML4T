**Date**: 2025-09-24T07:30:00Z  
**Epic**: ML4T-Alpha-Rebuild  
**Phase**: 3 - Production Deployment  
**Confidence**: Very High (95%+)  

## Overview

Task #29 implements intelligent feature selection from the expanded feature space created by OpenFE in Task #28. The system must reduce feature dimensionality from 500+ candidates to 50-100 optimal features while preserving alpha signal, eliminating multicollinearity, and maintaining Taiwan market compliance.

- Comprehensive testing and quality assurance

### Key Technical Requirements

**Feature Processing Pipeline**:
- **Input**: 500+ features from OpenFE (Task #28)
- **Statistical Filtering**: Correlation threshold <0.7, variance threshold >0.01
- **ML-Based Selection**: Top 100 features by importance + stability
- **Domain Validation**: Taiwan compliance + economic intuition
- **Final Output**: 50-100 optimal features for LightGBM

**Performance Targets**:
- Feature reduction ratio: 5-10x (500+ â†’ 50-100)
- Information Coefficient preservation: >90%
- Multicollinearity elimination: max correlation <0.7
- Processing time: <30 minutes for full universe
- Memory optimization: efficient chunked processing

### Taiwan Market Specific Validations

**Regulatory Compliance**:
- Features comply with Taiwan securities regulations
- No look-ahead bias in time-series features
- Respect T+2 settlement cycle constraints
- Align with 10% daily price limit impacts

**Economic Intuition Checks**:
- Feature interpretability and business logic validation
- Sector neutrality where appropriate
- Market microstructure relevance for Taiwan market
- Cross-sectional and time-series consistency

### Integration Architecture

**Dependencies**:
- **Task #28**: OpenFE feature generation (500+ candidates)
- **Task #26**: LightGBM pipeline for final integration testing
- **Task #25**: Original 42 factors as reference baseline

**Integration Points**:
- Feature input from OpenFE pipeline
- Statistical analysis using existing data infrastructure
- ML validation using LightGBM importance metrics
- Output integration with model pipeline

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation
