# Task #30 Analysis: Production Readiness Testing

**Date**: 2025-09-24T15:00:00Z  
**Epic**: ML4T-Alpha-Rebuild  
**Phase**: 3 - Production Deployment  
**Confidence**: Very High (95%+)  

## Overview

Task #30 focuses on comprehensive end-to-end testing and validation of the complete ML4T system before production deployment. The system must validate integration of all completed components (Tasks #21-29), ensure performance requirements are met, and verify Taiwan market compliance across the entire pipeline.
