# Epic: ML4T Alpha Enhancement (Performance-First Phase)

## Overview

**Critical Priority Epic**: Address the primary performance gap in ML4T system from 7.8% to 12%+ annual returns through systematic alpha enhancement before infrastructure development.

**Core Problem**: Current momentum strategy underperforms target by 35% (7.8% vs 12% annual returns) despite good risk-adjusted performance (1.85 Sharpe ratio).

**Strategic Approach**: Performance-First Hybrid methodology - prove alpha generation first, then build infrastructure around what works.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives (Must Achieve)
- **Annual Return**: 7.8% → 12%+ (target: 15%+)
- **Risk Control**: Max drawdown ≤15% (current: -18.3%)
- **Consistency**: Sharpe ratio >1.5 (maintain current 1.85+)
- **Validation**: 6-month forward testing confirmation

### Secondary Objectives (Nice to Have)
- **Win Rate**: >65% monthly positive returns
- **Regime Resilience**: Positive returns across bull/bear/crisis periods
- **Taiwan Optimization**: Outperform TAIEX by 3%+ annually

## Technical Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Alpha Drivers
1. **Taiwan Market Regime Detection**
   - Bull/Bear/Crisis/Sideways regime classification
   - ±10% daily limit integration
   - Tech sector concentration adjustments

2. **Dynamic Position Sizing**
   - Kelly Criterion implementation
   - Volatility targeting (15% portfolio vol)
   - Taiwan market liquidity constraints

3. **Enhanced Entry/Exit Timing**
   - Volume-adjusted momentum signals
   - Volatility-scaled position timing
   - Regime-aware signal amplification/dampening

### Phase 2: Strategy Optimization
1. **Multi-Timeframe Integration**
   - Daily signal confirmation for weekly strategy
   - Monthly trend overlay
   - Intraday volatility timing

2. **Taiwan-Specific Factors**
   - Export/semiconductor cycle indicators
   - Currency hedge ratios (TWD/USD)
   - Government policy reaction functions

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Core Engine**: Enhanced existing ML4T momentum framework
- **Data Source**: FinLab API + Taiwan market additions
- **Backtesting**: 10-year historical validation + walk-forward
- **Risk Management**: Real-time portfolio monitoring
- **Regime Detection**: Technical + fundamental hybrid approach

### Integration Strategy
- **Minimal Infrastructure**: Focus on alpha, not UI
- **Existing Codebase**: 80% reuse of current ML4T components
- **New Components**: Only critical alpha-generating enhancements
- **Testing Framework**: Systematic validation with success gates

## Task Breakdown

### Layer 1: Foundation Enhancement (Parallel Execution)
- **Task 1**: Taiwan Market Regime Detection System
- **Task 2**: Dynamic Position Sizing (Kelly + Vol Targeting)
- **Task 3**: Enhanced Technical Factors

### Layer 2: Strategy Integration (Sequential)
- **Task 4**: Multi-Regime Strategy Logic
- **Task 5**: Enhanced Backtesting Framework

### Layer 3: Validation & Optimization (Parallel)
- **Task 6**: 10-Year Historical Validation
- **Task 7**: Real-Time Performance Monitoring
- **Task 8**: Parameter Optimization & Tuning

**Total Estimated Hours**: 320 hours across 8 tasks
**Timeline**: 8 weeks (2 hours/day average)
**Success Gates**: Each layer must meet performance criteria before proceeding

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Overfitting**: Extensive out-of-sample testing required
- **Data Quality**: Taiwan market data integrity validation
- **Regime Changes**: Market structure evolution adaptation
- **Performance Degradation**: Live trading vs backtest gap

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Walk-Forward Validation**: Rolling 3-year windows
- **Paper Trading**: 3-month validation before live deployment
- **Conservative Estimates**: Transaction costs, slippage buffers
- **Gradual Scaling**: Start with 30% of target capital

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **ML4T Base System**: Existing momentum framework (completed)
- **FinLab Integration**: Taiwan market data access (completed)
- **Backtesting Infrastructure**: Historical data pipeline (completed)

### External Dependencies
- **Taiwan Stock Exchange**: Market data availability and quality
- **Regulatory Environment**: Taiwan market trading rules stability
- **Technology Platform**: Python/FinLab/pandas ecosystem

## Validation Framework

### Success Gates by Layer

**Layer 1 Gate**: Technical Implementation
- ✅ Regime detection accuracy >80%
- ✅ Position sizing variance <20%
- ✅ Factor calculations validated

**Layer 2 Gate**: Strategy Performance
- ✅ Backtested annual return >12%
- ✅ Sharpe ratio >1.5
- ✅ Max drawdown <15%

**Layer 3 Gate**: Production Readiness
- ✅ Paper trading validation successful
- ✅ Real-time monitoring operational
- ✅ Parameter stability confirmed

### Go/No-Go Criteria
- **GO**: All primary success criteria met with statistical significance
- **CONDITIONAL**: 2/3 primary criteria met, action plan for gaps
- **NO-GO**: <60% of success criteria achieved, requires strategy revision

## Timeline & Milestones

### Week 1-2: Layer 1 Foundation
- **Milestone 1**: Regime detection system operational
- **Milestone 2**: Dynamic position sizing implemented
- **Milestone 3**: Enhanced factors calculated and validated

### Week 3-4: Layer 2 Integration
- **Milestone 4**: Multi-regime strategy logic complete
- **Milestone 5**: Enhanced backtesting framework ready
- **Milestone 6**: Initial performance validation passed

### Week 5-6: Layer 3 Optimization
- **Milestone 7**: 10-year validation complete
- **Milestone 8**: Performance monitoring deployed
- **Milestone 9**: Parameter optimization finished

### Week 7-8: Final Validation
- **Milestone 10**: Paper trading initiated
- **Milestone 11**: Performance confirmation
- **Milestone 12**: Production readiness assessment

## Success Philosophy

**Evidence-Based Alpha**: Every enhancement must demonstrate measurable performance improvement through rigorous backtesting and statistical validation.

**Taiwan Market Focus**: Leverage unique Taiwan market characteristics (tech concentration, retail participation, policy sensitivity) for competitive advantage.

**Minimal Viable Enhancement**: Add only components that directly contribute to return generation - avoid feature creep and over-engineering.

**Risk-Conscious Growth**: Improve returns while maintaining or improving risk-adjusted metrics - no alpha at any cost approach.

## Next Phase Planning

Upon successful completion (12%+ validated returns):
- **Phase 2**: Minimal infrastructure (Streamlit dashboard, basic UI)
- **Phase 3**: Strategy expansion (additional timeframes, factors)
- **Phase 4**: Taiwan alternative data integration (broker research, sentiment)

**Investment Philosophy**: Prove alpha generation systematically before scaling infrastructure or complexity.
