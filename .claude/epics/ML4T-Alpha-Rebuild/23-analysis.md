# Issue #23 Analysis: Walk-Forward Validation Engine

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Core Validation Framework
**Focus**: Walk-forward validation engine, time-series cross-validation, Taiwan market adaptations
**Files**: 
- `src/backtesting/validation/walk_forward.py` - Core walk-forward engine
- `src/backtesting/validation/time_series_cv.py` - Time-series cross-validation
- `src/backtesting/validation/taiwan_specific.py` - Taiwan market validation rules

**Work**:
- Implement 156-week train / 26-week test framework
- Create purged K-fold cross-validation with gap periods
- Add Taiwan market-specific validation (T+2 settlement, holidays)
- Build rolling window validation with expanding/sliding windows
- Add regime detection and stability testing

### Stream B: Performance Attribution & Metrics
**Focus**: Performance measurement, attribution, risk-adjusted metrics, reporting
**Files**:
- `src/backtesting/metrics/performance.py` - Performance calculation engine
- `src/backtesting/metrics/attribution.py` - Performance attribution system
- `src/backtesting/metrics/risk_adjusted.py` - Sharpe, Information Ratio, etc.
- `src/backtesting/reporting/validation_reports.py` - Validation reporting

**Work**:
- Implement comprehensive performance metrics (Sharpe, IR, MDD)
- Build factor-based performance attribution system
- Add risk-adjusted return calculations with benchmarking
- Create automated validation reports with statistical significance
- Add Taiwan market benchmark comparisons (TAIEX, TPEx)

### Stream C: Integration & Testing
**Focus**: Point-in-time integration, bias prevention, comprehensive testing
**Files**:
- `src/backtesting/integration/pit_validator.py` - PIT system integration
- `tests/backtesting/test_walk_forward.py` - Core engine tests
- `tests/backtesting/test_taiwan_validation.py` - Taiwan market tests
- `benchmarks/validation_performance.py` - Performance benchmarks

**Work**:
- Integrate with Issues #21 (PIT data) and #22 (quality validation)
- Implement bias detection and prevention mechanisms
- Build comprehensive test suite for validation scenarios
- Create performance benchmarks for large-scale backtests
- Validate against historical Taiwan market periods

## Coordination Points
1. **Stream A** creates validation interfaces that **Stream B** measures
2. **Stream C** integrates **Stream A** with existing point-in-time and quality systems
3. **Stream B** provides metrics that **Stream C** validates for accuracy
4. All streams ensure Taiwan market compliance and zero look-ahead bias

## Dependencies
- **Issue #21**: Point-in-time data management system (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Issue #22**: Data quality validation framework (✅ COMPLETED)
- Integration with temporal data store and validation engine

## Success Criteria
- 156-week training / 26-week testing framework operational
- Purged K-fold cross-validation with proper gap periods
- Zero look-ahead bias in all validation procedures
- Taiwan market holiday and settlement handling
- Performance attribution with statistical significance
- Integration with existing point-in-time system

## Key Taiwan Market Requirements
- T+2 settlement lag in validation periods
- Taiwan stock exchange calendar integration
- Lunar New Year and typhoon trading suspensions
- Price limit and volume validation during backtests
- Corporate action handling in validation windows
