## Integration Points

### Stream A Integration
Successfully integrates with Stream A components:
- Uses `ValidationEngine` for core validation
- Leverages `TaiwanValidators` for market-specific rules
- Integrates with `RulesEngine` for configurable validation

### Data Flow
```
ValidationEngine → QualityMonitor → AlertManager
                                 → QualityMetricsAggregator → Dashboard
                                                           → ReportGenerator
```
