## Overview

Build a robust point-in-time data management system that handles Taiwan market specifics, including T+2 settlement lag and proper temporal data access controls to prevent look-ahead bias.

## Objectives

- Establish point-in-time data pipeline foundation
- Handle Taiwan market T+2 settlement lag correctly
- Integrate with existing incremental data updater
- Implement comprehensive data quality monitoring
- Prevent look-ahead bias in backtesting

## Taiwan Market Specifics

### Settlement Timing
- **T+2 Settlement**: Taiwan stock market uses T+2 settlement
- **Data Availability**: Corporate actions and financial data have reporting delays
- **Market Hours**: 09:00-13:30 TST (Taiwan Standard Time)
- **Trading Calendar**: Handle Taiwan-specific holidays and trading suspensions

### Data Constraints
- Financial statements: 60-day reporting lag after quarter end
- Dividend announcements: Variable timing, typically 1-3 months advance notice
- Stock splits/bonuses: Usually announced 1-2 weeks before ex-date
- Suspension handling: Stocks can be suspended for various reasons

## Technical Requirements

### Data Pipeline Architecture
```
Raw Data Sources → Temporal Validator → Point-in-Time Store → API Layer
                                    ↓
                              Quality Monitor → Alerts
```

### Core Components
1. **Temporal Data Store**
   - Time-indexed data with as-of timestamps
   - Efficient range queries by symbol and date
   - Support for data revisions and restatements

2. **Settlement Lag Handler**
   - Automatic T+2 offset for trade settlement
   - Configurable lag periods for different data types
   - Cash flow timing adjustments

3. **Data Quality Monitor**
   - Real-time validation of incoming data
   - Anomaly detection (price spikes, volume outliers)
   - Missing data detection and alerting
   - Data lineage tracking

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Interface with existing incremental updater
   - Backward compatibility with current data access patterns
   - Migration path from legacy data storage

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Point-in-time data access API implemented
- [ ] T+2 settlement lag correctly applied to all trade-related data
- [ ] No look-ahead bias possible in data retrieval
- [ ] Historical data backfill completed for 5+ years
- [ ] Real-time data ingestion pipeline operational

### Data Quality
- [ ] Comprehensive validation rules implemented
- [ ] Missing data detection with <5 minute alert latency
- [ ] Price/volume anomaly detection with 99.5% accuracy
- [ ] Data lineage tracking for audit purposes
- [ ] Automated data quality reports generated daily

### Performance
- [ ] Sub-100ms query response for single symbol/date
- [ ] Bulk data retrieval: 10K records per second minimum
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for data ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Storage optimization: <50% increase over current usage

### Integration
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing backtesting framework
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for legacy systems
- [ ] Migration scripts created and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated for new data access patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Point-in-time data table
CREATE TABLE pit_data (
    symbol VARCHAR(10),
    data_type VARCHAR(50),
    as_of_date DATE,
    value_date DATE,
    value DECIMAL(15,6),
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX(symbol, data_type, as_of_date),
    INDEX(value_date, symbol)
);

-- Settlement calendar
CREATE TABLE settlement_calendar (
    trade_date DATE,
    settlement_date DATE,
    is_trading_day BOOLEAN,
    market_session VARCHAR(20)
);
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /data/pit/{symbol}?as_of={date}&fields={list}` - Point-in-time data retrieval
- `GET /data/bulk?symbols={list}&date_range={start,end}` - Bulk historical data
- `POST /data/quality/validate` - Manual data quality check
- `GET /data/calendar/trading/{start_date}/{end_date}` - Trading calendar

### Data Sources Integration
- Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) real-time feed
- Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ) fundamental data
- Existing PostgreSQL historical database
- Corporate actions feed from data vendor

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Volume Growth**: Implement partitioning and archival strategies
- **Query Performance**: Use appropriate indexing and caching layers
- **Data Consistency**: Implement transaction-safe updates with rollback capability

### Market Risks
- **Settlement Changes**: Design configurable settlement rules
- **Holiday Calendar Updates**: Automated calendar synchronization
- **Data Vendor Issues**: Multiple data source redundancy

## Definition of Done

1. Point-in-time data system deployed to production
2. All Taiwan market timing constraints correctly implemented
3. Data quality monitoring operational with alerting
4. Integration with existing systems completed
5. Performance benchmarks met
6. Documentation complete and team trained
7. Monitoring and alerting configured
8. Backup and disaster recovery procedures tested

## Dependencies

This is a foundation task with no dependencies. All other Phase 1 tasks depend on this implementation.

## Success Metrics

- Zero look-ahead bias incidents in backtesting
- 99.9% data availability during market hours
- <100ms average query response time
- 100% settlement timing accuracy
- Data quality alerts resolved within 15 minutes average
