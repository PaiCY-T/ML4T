## Context

OpenFE provides automated feature engineering capabilities that can significantly expand our feature space from the foundational 42 factors. This integration enables systematic feature discovery and generation tailored for Taiwan market characteristics.

## Technical Requirements

### OpenFE Installation & Configuration
- Install OpenFE library with all dependencies
- Configure OpenFE for financial time series data
- Set up Taiwan market-specific parameters and constraints
- Establish memory and compute resource limits

### Pipeline Integration
- Integrate OpenFE with existing data processing pipeline
- Create automated feature generation workflow from 42 base factors
- Implement batch processing for historical data
- Set up incremental feature generation for new data

### Taiwan Market Adaptations
- Configure OpenFE for Taiwan stock market trading hours
- Adapt feature generation for local market microstructure
- Implement sector-specific feature engineering rules
- Add support for Taiwan-specific market events and holidays

### Feature Generation Framework
- Generate comprehensive feature set from base factors
- Implement cross-sectional and time-series transformations
- Create interaction features between fundamental and technical factors
- Set up automated feature naming and documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OpenFE library successfully installed and configured
- [ ] Integration with existing data pipeline completed
