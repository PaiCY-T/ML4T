## Overview

Implement a sophisticated walk-forward validation engine with 156-week training / 26-week testing framework, incorporating purged K-fold cross-validation and performance attribution tracking specifically designed for Taiwan market quantitative trading strategies.

## Objectives

- Build 156-week train / 26-week test walk-forward framework
- Implement time-series cross-validation system
- Create purged K-fold cross-validation for time series
- Add comprehensive performance attribution tracking
- Ensure proper handling of Taiwan market characteristics

## Taiwan Market Walk-Forward Specifics

### Market Cycle Considerations
- **Economic Cycles**: Taiwan's export-driven economy has distinct cycles
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Chinese New Year impact (1-2 week market closure)
- **Regulatory Changes**: Factor in Taiwan financial regulation updates
- **Cross-Strait Relations**: Political events impact market dynamics

### Validation Period Design
- **Training Period**: 156 weeks (≈3 years) to capture full market cycles
- **Test Period**: 26 weeks (≈6 months) for out-of-sample validation
- **Purge Period**: 2 weeks between train/test to prevent look-ahead bias
- **Minimum History**: 5 years of data before first validation window

### Market Characteristics
- **Limited Universe**: ~1,700 listed companies (smaller than US markets)
- **Liquidity Constraints**: Many small-cap stocks with low liquidity
- **Sector Concentration**: Technology and manufacturing heavy weighting
- **Foreign Investment**: Significant foreign institutional presence

## Technical Requirements

### Walk-Forward Engine Architecture
```
Data Pipeline → Validation Engine → Model Training → Out-of-Sample Testing
                      ↓                   ↓               ↓

        self.train_weeks = train_weeks
        self.test_weeks = test_weeks
        self.purge_weeks = purge_weeks
        
    def split(self, data, start_date, end_date):
        """Generate walk-forward splits with Taiwan market adjustments"""
        splits = []
        current_date = start_date + timedelta(weeks=self.train_weeks)
        
        while current_date + timedelta(weeks=self.test_weeks) <= end_date:
            train_start = current_date - timedelta(weeks=self.train_weeks)
            train_end = current_date

            test_end = test_start + timedelta(weeks=self.test_weeks)
            
            # Adjust for Taiwan market calendar
            train_dates = self._adjust_for_market_calendar(train_start, train_end)
            test_dates = self._adjust_for_market_calendar(test_start, test_end)

        purge_size = int(n_samples * self.purge_pct)
        embargo_size = int(n_samples * self.embargo_pct)
        
        for i in range(self.n_splits):
            test_start = i * test_size
            test_end = test_start + test_size
            
            # Create purged training set
            train_indices = []
            
            # Before test period (with embargo)
            if test_start > embargo_size:
                train_indices.extend(range(0, test_start - embargo_size))
            
            # After test period (with purge)
            if test_end + purge_size < n_samples:
                train_indices.extend(range(test_end + purge_size, n_samples))
            
            test_indices = list(range(test_start, test_end))
            
            yield train_indices, test_indices
```

### Performance Attribution Framework
```python
class PerformanceAttributor:

        self.benchmark = benchmark
        self.factors = ['market', 'size', 'value', 'momentum', 'quality']
        
    def attribute_returns(self, portfolio_returns, factor_exposures, factor_returns):
        """Decompose portfolio returns into factor contributions"""
        attribution = {}
        
        # Factor contributions
        for factor in self.factors:
            exposure = factor_exposures[factor]
            factor_ret = factor_returns[factor]
            attribution[f'{factor}_contribution'] = exposure * factor_ret
        
        # Specific return (alpha)
        total_factor_return = sum(attribution.values())
        attribution['specific_return'] = portfolio_returns - total_factor_return
        
        # Risk-adjusted metrics
        attribution['sharpe_ratio'] = self._calculate_sharpe(portfolio_returns)
        attribution['sortino_ratio'] = self._calculate_sortino(portfolio_returns)
        attribution['calmar_ratio'] = self._calculate_calmar(portfolio_returns)

        return attribution
```

### Taiwan Market Calendar Integration
```python
class TaiwanMarketCalendar:
    def __init__(self):
        self.holidays = self._load_taiwan_holidays()
        self.market_hours = {'open': '09:00', 'close': '13:30'}
        
    def is_trading_day(self, date):
        """Check if date is a trading day in Taiwan"""
        if date.weekday() >= 5:  # Weekend
            return False
        if date in self.holidays:
            return False
        return True
        
    def adjust_date_range(self, start_date, end_date):
