## Overview

Build a comprehensive data quality validation framework that ensures data integrity, handles Taiwan market-specific validation rules, and provides real-time monitoring with automated alerting for data quality issues.

## Objectives

- Implement comprehensive data validation system
- Handle 60-day financial data lag for Taiwan market
- Ensure no look-ahead bias in data access validation
- Build automated quality monitoring and alerts
- Create data quality dashboards and reporting

## Taiwan Market Data Quality Specifics

### Financial Data Timing Constraints
- **Quarterly Reports**: 60-day reporting lag after quarter end
- **Annual Reports**: 90-day reporting lag after year end
- **Monthly Revenue**: Released by 10th of following month
- **Dividend Information**: Available 1-3 months before ex-date

### Market Data Validation Rules
- **Price Limits**: Daily price movement limits (10% for most stocks)
- **Volume Validation**: Unusual volume spikes (>5x 20-day average)
- **Corporate Actions**: Split/dividend adjustments validation
- **Suspension Handling**: Trading halt detection and data gap management

## Technical Requirements

### Validation Framework Architecture
```
Data Ingestion → Real-time Validators → Quality Score → Alert Engine
                      ↓                      ↓             ↓
                Data Warehouse ←    Quality DB    →   Dashboard
```

### Core Validation Components

1. **Real-time Data Validators**
   - Price movement validation (circuit breakers)
   - Volume anomaly detection
   - Missing data gap identification
   - Timestamp consistency checking

2. **Historical Data Validators**
   - Survivorship bias detection
   - Point-in-time consistency verification
   - Corporate action adjustment validation
   - Financial statement timing validation

3. **Cross-sectional Validators**
   - Market capitalization consistency
   - Sector/industry classification validation
   - Index constituent validation
   - Correlation-based outlier detection

4. **Temporal Validators**
   - Look-ahead bias prevention
   - Settlement timing compliance
   - Financial data availability validation
   - Restatement detection and handling

## Technical Implementation

### Validation Rule Engine
```python
class ValidationRule:
    def __init__(self, name, rule_type, severity, taiwan_specific=False):
        self.name = name
        self.rule_type = rule_type  # real_time, historical, cross_sectional
        self.severity = severity    # critical, warning, info
        self.taiwan_specific = taiwan_specific
    
    def validate(self, data, context):
        # Rule implementation
        pass

# Taiwan-specific validation rules
rules = [
    ValidationRule("daily_price_limit", "real_time", "critical", True),
    ValidationRule("financial_data_lag", "temporal", "critical", True),
    ValidationRule("settlement_t2", "temporal", "critical", True),
    ValidationRule("volume_spike", "real_time", "warning", False),
    # ... more rules
]
```

### Quality Score Calculation
```python
def calculate_quality_score(symbol, date, validation_results):
    """
    Calculate data quality score (0-100) based on validation results
    Weights: Critical=50%, Warning=30%, Info=20%
    """
    weights = {"critical": 0.5, "warning": 0.3, "info": 0.2}
    
    total_score = 100
    for result in validation_results:
        if not result.passed:
            penalty = weights[result.severity] * result.impact_factor
            total_score -= penalty
    
    return max(0, total_score)
```

### Alert Configuration
```yaml
alert_rules:
  critical_quality_drop:
    condition: "quality_score < 90"
    channels: ["email", "slack", "pager"]
    frequency: "immediate"
    
  missing_data:
    condition: "missing_data_percentage > 5"
    channels: ["email", "slack"]
    frequency: "every_5_minutes"
    
  volume_anomaly:
    condition: "volume_spike_factor > 10"
    channels: ["slack"]
    frequency: "once_per_symbol_per_day"
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Data quality results
CREATE TABLE data_quality_results (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol VARCHAR(10),

    symbol VARCHAR(10),
    triggered_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    details JSONB
);

- **Data Volume Growth**: Implement rule prioritization and sampling

### Market Risks
- **Volatile Market Conditions**: Adaptive thresholds during high volatility
- **Corporate Action Complexity**: Comprehensive test coverage
