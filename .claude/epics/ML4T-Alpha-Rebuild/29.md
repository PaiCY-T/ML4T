# Task 29: Feature Selection & Correlation Filtering

**Epic**: ML4T-Alpha-Rebuild  
**Phase**: Phase 3 - OpenFE Integration  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: L (3-4 days)  
**Dependencies**: [28]  
**Parallel**: false  

**Created**: 2025-09-23T13:07:08Z  
**Status**: pending  

## Objective

Implement comprehensive feature selection and correlation filtering system to reduce the OpenFE-generated feature space from 500+ candidates to optimal subset, using hierarchical clustering and IC decay tracking for systematic feature management.

## Context

With OpenFE generating hundreds of potential features, systematic selection is crucial to avoid overfitting and maintain model performance. This task establishes automated feature selection using correlation analysis, information coefficient tracking, and feature stability metrics.

## Technical Requirements

### Hierarchical Clustering for Correlation Filtering
- Implement hierarchical clustering on feature correlation matrix
- Apply 0.7 correlation threshold for feature grouping
- Select representative features from each cluster
- Maintain feature diversity across fundamental and technical domains

### IC Decay Tracking System
- Build Information Coefficient (IC) calculation framework
- Implement rolling IC analysis with configurable windows
- Track feature IC decay over time (monthly, quarterly)
- Automate feature retirement when ICIR < 0.05 threshold

### Feature Stability Analysis
- Implement feature stability scoring using PSI (Population Stability Index)
- Track feature distribution changes over time
- Monitor feature availability and data quality
- Create feature reliability scoring system

### Performance Comparison Framework
- Build A/B testing framework for feature sets
- Implement statistical significance testing for feature performance
- Create feature contribution analysis tools
- Establish baseline comparison metrics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hierarchical clustering successfully reduces feature space by 60-80%
- [ ] IC decay tracking system operational with automated alerts
- [ ] Feature retirement mechanism working (ICIR < 0.05 threshold)
- [ ] Feature stability analysis identifying stable vs. unstable features
- [ ] Performance comparison framework validating feature selection quality
- [ ] Final feature set contains 100-200 optimal features
- [ ] Feature selection process documented and reproducible
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard for feature performance tracking

## Technical Specifications

### Correlation Filtering
- **Method**: Hierarchical clustering with ward linkage
- **Threshold**: 0.7 correlation for feature grouping
- **Selection**: Top IC-weighted feature per cluster
- **Output**: 60-80% reduction in feature count

### IC Analysis Framework
- **Calculation**: Spearman rank correlation with forward returns
- **Windows**: 1M, 3M, 6M, 12M rolling periods
- **Threshold**: ICIR < 0.05 for retirement consideration
- **Frequency**: Daily IC updates, monthly decay analysis

### Feature Stability Metrics
- **PSI Calculation**: Monthly distribution comparison
- **Stability Threshold**: PSI > 0.1 indicates instability
- **Availability Tracking**: Missing data percentage monitoring
- **Quality Scoring**: Combined stability and availability metrics

### Performance Framework
- **Backtesting**: Rolling window validation (252 trading days)
- **Metrics**: IC, IR, Sharpe ratio, turnover analysis
- **Statistical Tests**: t-test for IC significance, Diebold-Mariano for forecast comparison
- **Reporting**: Monthly performance attribution by feature groups

## Implementation Notes

- Integrate with existing backtesting framework from Phase 2
- Use Taiwan market-specific return calculation methods
- Implement feature selection pipeline as modular components
- Create feature metadata tracking for governance and audit
- Build automated reporting for feature performance monitoring

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for correlation clustering and IC calculations
- Integration tests with OpenFE feature generation pipeline
- Backtesting validation using historical Taiwan market data
- Performance regression testing against baseline feature sets
- Edge case testing for extreme market conditions (COVID-19, major corrections)

## Deliverables

1. Hierarchical clustering correlation filter implementation
2. IC decay tracking and automated retirement system
3. Feature stability analysis framework
4. Performance comparison and A/B testing tools
5. Optimized feature set (100-200 features) with documentation
6. Feature monitoring dashboard and alerting system
7. Feature selection methodology documentation
8. Performance attribution analysis tools

## Taiwan Market Considerations

- Account for Taiwan market concentration (tech sector dominance)
- Handle Taiwan-specific market events and holidays in IC calculation
- Consider TSE trading hour effects on feature stability
- Implement sector-balanced feature selection to avoid overconcentration
