# Issue #004: ML Model Pipeline

## Overview
Implement LightGBM model pipeline with hyperparameter tuning and time-series validation.

## Scope
**Timeline**: Week 6-7 (48 hours)
**Dependencies**: Issues #002, #003 (Backtesting + Factors)
**Parallel Streams**: 2

## Stream A: LightGBM Implementation (32h)
**Files**: `src/models/lightgbm/`, `src/models/training/`
**Responsibilities**:
- LightGBM model implementation
- Hyperparameter optimization (Optuna)
- Time-series cross-validation
- Model training pipeline
- Feature importance analysis

## Stream B: Model Infrastructure (16h)
**Files**: `src/models/core/`, `src/models/monitoring/`
**Responsibilities**:
- Model performance monitoring
- Prediction pipeline
- Model serialization/loading
- Performance validation framework
- Model drift detection setup

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] LightGBM training pipeline functional
- [ ] Hyperparameter optimization working
- [ ] Time-series CV preventing data leakage
- [ ] Feature importance tracking active
- [ ] Model monitoring system operational
- [ ] Prediction pipeline < 1s latency
- [ ] Model serialization working
- [ ] Performance validation comprehensive

## Technical Requirements
- LightGBM with GPU support (optional)
