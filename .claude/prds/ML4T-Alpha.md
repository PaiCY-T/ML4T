# PRD: ML4T Alpha Enhancement System

## Product Overview

**Product Name**: ML4T Alpha Enhancement Engine
**Version**: 1.0
**Target Users**: Quantitative trader (individual/small team)
**Product Type**: Performance optimization system for existing ML4T framework

## Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points
1. **Underperformance**: 7.8% annual returns vs 12% target (35% shortfall)
2. **Excessive Drawdowns**: -18.3% max drawdown exceeds -15% risk tolerance
3. **Regime Blindness**: Single-regime strategy fails in different market conditions
